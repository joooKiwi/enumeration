# The example for the Enumerable implementation

This folder is **not meant** to be compilable.

It is meant to be an example directory for common use-case.

The implementations use the inheritance from classes.
Maybe later on, a composition implementation may be compatible and replace it.

## Javascript / Typescript implementation

The Javascript implementation is the most restrictive since
it cannot rely on `Annotation` or `Attribute` like in Java or C#.

Hence, it is using fields in the class to describe its content using the `static` context.
But other than that, nothing uses the `static` context.

And if it is about the `Typescript`, then the implementation has the typing to its advantage.

## Java implementation

This has currently not been created.

It will be done in correlation with the `Kotlin` and maybe the `C#` implementation.

## Kotlin implementation

This has currently not been created.

It will be done in correlation with the `Java` and maybe the `C#` implementation.

## C# implementation

This has currently not been created.

It could be done in correlation with the `Java` and `Kotlin` implementation.

## PHP implementation

This has currently not been created.

It could be done after the `C#` implementation.
